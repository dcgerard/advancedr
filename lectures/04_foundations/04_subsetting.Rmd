# Learning Objectives

- How to subset vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, ...
- Chapter 4 from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
    - These lecture notes are mostly taken straight out of Hadley's book. Many thanks for making my life easier.

# Subsetting an Atomic Vector

- **Subsetting** is extracting elements from an object.
    - Subset because you only want some elements of a vector.
    - Subset so you can assign new elements to that subset.
    
- Six ways to subset atomic vector.

```{r}
x <- c(8, 1.2, 33, 14)
```


- **Integer Subsetting**:
    - Put integers in brackets and it will extract those elements. R starts counting at 1.
        ```{r}
        x[1]
        x[c(1, 3)]
        iset <- c(1, 3)
        x[iset]
        ```
    - This can be used for sorting
        ```{r}
        order(x)
        x[order(x)]
        ```
    - You can use duplicate integers to extract elements more than once.
        ```{r}
        x[c(2, 2, 2)]
        ```
- **Negative Integer Subsetting**:
