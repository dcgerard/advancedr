# Learning Objectives

- Formal characterization of functions.
- Chapter 6 from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
    - These lecture notes are mostly taken straight out of Hadley's book. Many thanks for making my life easier.
    - His images, which I use here, are licensed under <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" height="15" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png"/></a>

# Components

A function has three parts:

1. The `formals()`, the list of arguments that control how you call the function.
2. The `body()`, the code inside the function.
3. The `environment()`, the data structure that determines how the function finds the values associated with the names.

```{r}
square <- function(x) {
  x^2
}
formals(square)
body(square)
environment(square)
```

- Below: Black dot is environment, squares are arguments. Body is not graphed.

- **Exception**: Many base functions are written directly in C and don't have these three components.

    ```{r}
    typeof(square)
    typeof(sum)
    typeof(`[[`)
    
    body(sum)
    formals(sum)
    ```

# First class functions

- Functions are objects, just like any other variable.

- Sometimes, functions are called **closures** because they "enclose" their environments (see Chapter 7). That's why you sometimes see the error
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    lm[1]
    ```
    I.e., you cannot subset a function.

- So you can pass functions as arguments in a function (like in `optim()`).

    ```{r}
    f <- function(par, dat) {
      sum((par - dat)^2)
    }
    dat <- rnorm(100)
    oout <- optim(par = 0, fn = f, dat = dat, method = "L-BFGS-B")
    oout$par
    mean(dat)
    ```

- Functions can return other functions (like in `ecdf()`).

    ```{r}
    x <- c(1, 99, 2, 11)
    efun <- ecdf(x)
    efun(10)
    ```
    
- Functions can be elements of a list.

    ```{r}
    funs <- list(
      half = function(x) x / 2,
      double = function(x) x * 2
    )
    
    funs$double(10)
    ```

- Because functions are objects, Hadley graphically represents name bindings in a similar way to variables:

    <img src="./04_figs_fun/first-class.png" alt="some S3 objects" width="15%"/>

- Functions can also be **anonymous** in R

    ```{r}
    (function(x) x^2)(2)
    (function(x) x^2)(3)
    ```

    - This is most often used when you don't want to be bothered with thinking up a name.
    
    ```{r}
    ## Integrate anonymous function from -infinity to infinity
    integrate(function(x) exp(-x^2), -Inf, Inf)
    
    ## apply anonymous function to each column of mtcars
    sapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x))) 
    ```
    
# Lexical Scoping

- **Scoping** is the act of finding a value associated with a name. That is, you have `x` as a variable name in different parts of a program. When does it point to some objects versus others?

- E.g., when is `x` pointing to 20 versus 10 in the code below?

    ```{r}
    x <- 10
    g01 <- function() {
      x <- 20
      x
    }
    ```

    - `x` points to 10 outside of the function, and points to 20 inside of the function.
    
- R uses [lexical scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope), meaning that a name refers to an object based on when the function is defined.

- In a lexically scoped language, a *block* defines a new scope. Variables are defined/declared in that scope and are not visible outside of that scope. Blocks can be nested, and when a variable is defined in an outer block, then it is visible in the inner block. But variables defined in the inner block are not defined in the outer block. E.g.

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    outer_var <- 10
    f <- function() {
      print(outer_var)
      inner_var <- 1
    }
    f() ## outer_var is available in inner block though it is defined in outer block.
    inner_var ## inner_var not available in outer block because defined in inner block.
    ```

- Other types of scoping exist, such as [dynamic scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Dynamic_scope), meaning that a name refers to an object based on when the function is called. Most languages don't use dynamic scope. One language that does use dynamic scope is bash.

- Let's formalize this mechanism.

## Name Masking

- Names inside a function mask names defined outside a function.

- If a name is not defined in a function, R looks up one level.

    ```{r}
    x <- 2
    y <- 20
    g03 <- function() {
      y <- 1
      return(c(x, y))
    }
    g03()
    
    # This doesn't change the previous value of y
    y
    ```

- If a function is defined inside a function, then it keeps looking up levels until it finds a variable.

- Below, the inner function finds `z` inside the inner function, finds `y` in the outer function, and finds `x` outside both functions. 
    ```{r}
    x <- 1
    f1 <- function() {
      y <- 2
      f2 <- function() {
        z <- 3
        return(c(x, y, z))
      }
      return(f2())
    }
    f1()
    ```

## A fresh start

- Each time a function is called, it creates a new environment to execute in.

- This means it does not remember what happened last time.

    ```{r}
    a <- 2
    g11 <- function() {
      a <- a + 1
      return(a)
    }
    
    g11()
    g11()
    ```

## Functions versus variables

- Functions and variables can share names (though, this is not a good idea).

```{r}
sum <- c(10, 11)
sum(sum)
```

- This is allowed since the function and the variable are in different environments. XYZ Explain this more.

## Dynamic lookup

- R determines *where* to look at function creation time (e.g. one level up), but it determines *what* is there at evaluation time.

```{r}
a <- 1
g11()

a <- 12
g11()
```

## Advanced R Exercises

1. What does the following code return? Why? Describe how each of the three c’s is interpreted.

    ```{r}
    c <- 10
    c(c = c)
    ```
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    The first `c` is the function name for combine, the second `c` is a name attribute, the third `c` is a name pointing to `10`.
    ```
    

2. What does the following function return? Make a prediction before running the code yourself.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f <- function(x) {
      f <- function(x) {
        f <- function() {
          x ^ 2
        }
        f() + 1
      }
      f(x) * 2
    }
    f(10)
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    202. 10 gets passed to f(10)^2 * 2, where f(10) is 10^2 + 1
    ```

# Lazy Evaluation

- **lazy evaluation** is where a variable is only evaluated if used.

- R arguments are lazily evaluated. So the following does not show an error, even though `x` is not defined.

    ```{r}
    f <- function(x) {
      return(10)
    }
    
    f()
    ```

- In R, lazy evaluation is done via a *promise* data object, which is described in Chapter 20.

- But an important consequence of lazy evaluation is that default arguments can be defined in terms of other arguments.

    ```{r}
    h04 <- function(x = NULL, y = x * 2, z = a + b) {
      a <- 10
      b <- 100
      
      if (is.null(x)) {
        x <- 4
      }
      
      c(x, y, z)
    }
    
    h04()
    ```

- I've used this property before, e.g., for choosing initial values of an optimization approach based on the input data.

- Note that default arguments are evaluated inside the function, while user supplied arguments are evaluated outside the function.

- This example from Advanced R blew my mind:
    ```{r}
    h05 <- function(x = ls()) { ## ls() is default argument
      a <- 1
      x
    }
    
    # ls() evaluated inside h05:
    h05()
    
    # ls() evaluated in global environment:
    h05(ls()) ## ls() is user supplied
    ```

- **Exercise** (Advanced R): What does this function return? Why?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f2 <- function(x = z) {
      z <- 100
      x
    }
    f2()
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    It returns 100. It does so because `x` is only lazily evaluated when it is used, after which `z` is defined.
    ```

- **Exercise** (Advanced R): What does this function return? Why?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    y <- 10
    f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
      c(x, y)
    }
    f1()
    y
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    `f1()` returns `c(2, 1)` because when `x` is evaluated that is one `y <- 1` is evaluated. Note that `x` has a default argument of `2` because it is the last thing returned in that expression.
    
    Note that `y` is only assigned inside the function, so `y <- 10` is not overwritten.
    ```

# `...` (dot-dot-dot)

- In R, the dot-dot-dot argument is a special argument which allows a function to take any number of additional arguments beyond those defined by the user.

- This is used all over the place in R. See `seq()`, `optim()`, `plot()`, `print()`, etc...

- In computer science, this type of argument is called a "varargs"

- Typically, you either do one of two things with `...` in a function:
    1. Assign arguments to a list.
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        args <- list(...)
        ```
    2. Pass arguments to another function.
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        fn(...)
        ```
    
- E.g. I pass the extra arguments to a list so that I can check if they are `NULL` in the list, then I pass the extra arguments to `plot()`.

    ```{r}
    plotd <- function(x, y, ...) {
      args <- list(...)
      args$x <- x
      args$y <- y
      if (is.null(args$pch)) {
        args$pch <- 16
      }
      if (is.null(args$mar)) {
        args$mar <- c(3, 3, 2, 1)
      }
      if (is.null(args$mgp)) {
        args$mgp <- c(1.8, 0.4, 0)
      }
      if (is.null(args$las)) {
        args$las <- 1
      }
      if (is.null(args$tcl)) {
        args$tcl <- -0.25
      }
      do.call(what = plot, args = args)
    }
    ```

- I can pass more arguments to this function, or overwrite defaults
    ```{r}
    plotd(x = mtcars$wt, 
          y = mtcars$mpg, 
          main = "Motor Trends Cars",
          xlab = "Weight", 
          ylab = "MPG",
          pch = 19)
    ```
   
- `do.call()` is one way to call a function. You write the name of the function and provide a list of its arguments.

- **Exercise**: Why do you think we get an error here?

    ```{r, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    plot2 <- function(x, y, ...) {
      if (!hasArg(pch)) {
        pch <- 16
        cat("pch assigned")
      }
      plot(x = x, y = y, pch = pch)
    }
    plot2(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
    plot2(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, pch = 19)
    ```
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    Arguments are not evaluated unless (i) passed to another function or (ii) stored as a list.
    ```

- If you want to just change one default, it is perhaps better to just include it as an additional argument.
    ```{r}
    plot3 <- function(x, y, pch = 16, ...) {
      plot(x = x, y = y, pch = pch, ...)
    }
    plot3(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
    plot3(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, pch = 19)
    ```

# Function exits

## Implicit versus explicit returns

- R will return the last evaluated expression by default:
    ```{r}
    f <- function(x, y) {
      y
      x
    }
    f(1, 2)
    ```
    
- I prefer to explicitly include a `return()` call:
    ```{r}
    f <- function(x, y) {
      y
      return(x)
    }
    f(1, 2)
    ```

## Visible versus invisible returns

- A visible return prints the result:
    ```{r}
    f <- function(x) {
      return(x)
    }
    f(1)
    ```

- You can prevent automatic printing by applying `invisible()`.
    ```{r}
    f <- function(x) {
      return(invisible(x))
    }
    f(1)
    ```
    
- We can print the value with `print()`.
    ```{r}
    f(1) |>
      print()
    ```
    or by enclosing in parentheses:
    ```{r}
    (f(1))
    ```
    
- Assignment is a function with returns invisibly:
    ```{r}
    x <- 1
    (x <- 1)
    ```

- You might be surprised that assignment is a function, but remember in R almost everything is a function. Prefix notation might make it more clear:
    ```{r}
    `<-`(x, 10)
    x
    ```

- `invisible()` returns are often used for arguments whose main purpose are side effects (like `print()` or `plot()` functions), so that you can chain arguments.

    ```{r}
    a <- b <- c <- d <- 2
    a
    b
    c
    d
    ```

## Exit handlers

- If you change the global state (e.g. the `options()` arguments), then it is polite to revert back on exit.

- Use `on.exit()` to do so, setting `add = TRUE` to not overwrite previous exit handlers.

    ```{r}
    cleanup <- function(dir, code) {
      old_dir <- setwd(dir)
      on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE)
      
      # I can now change the working directory with impunity
      
      old_opt <- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
      on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE)
      
      # I can now change the options with impunity
    }
    ```

- I have used this in real life when manipulating the parallelization backend using the `{foreach}` package

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    oldDoPar <- doFuture::registerDoFuture()
    on.exit(with(oldDoPar, foreach::setDoPar(fun=fun, data=data, info=info)), add = TRUE)
    ```

# Function Forms

- Hadley's Function Forms:
    - **prefix**: the function name comes before its arguments, like `foofy(a, b, c)`. These constitute of the majority of function calls in R.
    - **infix**: the function name comes in between its arguments, like `x + y`. Infix forms are used for many mathematical operators, and for user-defined functions that begin and end with `%`.
    - **replacement**: functions that replace values by assignment, like `names(df) <- c("a", "b", "c")`. They actually look like prefix functions.
    - **special**: functions like `[[`, `if`, and `for`. While they don’t have a consistent structure, they play important roles in R’s syntax.

- You can rewrite all forms in prefix form

    ```{r}
    x + y ## infix 
    `+`(x, y) ## prefix
    
    df <- data.frame(1:2, c("a", "b"), c(TRUE, FALSE))
    names(df) <- c("x", "y", "z") ## replacement
    `names<-`(df, c("x", "y", "z")) ## prefix
    
    for(i in 1:10) print(i) ## special
    `for`(i, 1:10, print(i)) ## prefix
    ```

- You can create your own infix functions by starting and ending them with `%`

    ```{r}
    `%+%` <- function(a, b) paste0(a, b)
    
    "hello" %+% "world"
    ```

- You can create your own replacement functions. 
    - They must end in `<-`
    - They must have arguments `x` and `value` and
    - They must return the modified argument.

- The following will replace the second 
```{r}
`second<-` <- function(x, value) {
  x[2] <- value
  x
}

x <- 1:10
second(x) <- 12
x
```

- You can include additional arguments by placing them between `x` and `value` and including them on the left-hand size.

    ```{r}
    `modify<-` <- function(x, position, value) {
      x[position] <- value
      x
    }
    modify(x, 1) <- 10
    x
    ```

# Advanced R Exercises:

1. Rewrite the following code snippets into prefix form:

    ```{r}
    1 + 2 + 3
    
    1 + (2 + 3)
    
    if (length(x) <= 5) x[[length(x)]] else x[[5]]
    ```

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    `+`(`+`(1, 2), 3)
    `+`(1, `+`(2, 3))
    
    n <- length(x)
    `if`(`<=`(length(x), 5), `[[`(x, length(x)), `[[`(x, 5))
    ```

    - For the last one, make sure to convert `if`, `else`, `[[`, and `<=` all into prefix form.

2. Create a replacement function called `rmod()` that modifies a random location in a vector. E.g.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
    `rmod<-` <- function(x, value) {
      x[sample(seq_along(x), size = 1)] <- value
      return(x)
    }
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    set.seed(1)
    x <- 1:10
    rmod(x) <- NA
    x
    rmod(x) <- NA
    x
    ```

3. Write your own version of `+` that pastes its inputs together if they are character vectors but behaves as usual otherwise. In other words, make this code work:

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    `+` <- function(x, y) {
      if (is.character(x) || is.character(y)) {
        return(paste0(x, y))
      } else {
        return(.Primitive("+")(x, y))
      }
    }
    ```


    ```{r}
    1 + 2
    "a" + "b"
    ```

    - *Hint*: Look at the source code of `+`.

4. Create an infix `xor()` operator. Call it `%x|%`. E.g.

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    `%x|%` <- function(x, y) {
      return(xor(x, y))
    }
    ```

    ```{r}
    c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) %x|% c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
    ```

5. Create infix versions of the set functions `intersect()`, `union()`, and `setdiff()`. You might call them `%n%`, `%u%`, and `%/%` to match conventions from mathematics.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    `%n%` <- function(x, y) {
      return(intersect(x, y))
    }
    
    `%u%` <- function(x, y) {
      return(union(x, y))
    }
    
    `%/%` <- function(x, y) {
      return(setdiff(x, y))
    }
    ```


# New functions:

- `do.call()`: Run a function with a list of arguments.
- `invisible()`: Return without automatic printing.
- `on.exit()`: Runs an expression when the function exits, whether naturally or by an error.
