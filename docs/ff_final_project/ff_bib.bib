 abstract = {It is counterintuitive that, with a sample of only one value from a normal distribution, one can construct a finite confidence interval of any size for the mean. It goes just as much against standard teaching that from a sample of size two such a CI might be shorter than that based on the t statistic. We refine an earlier version of this first result, and use it to prove the second. For samples of three and larger, we show that the t-based interval cannot be improved using this approach.},

	Abstract = {The process of method evaluation starts with identifying goals either to demonstrate the clinical validity of an assay or to identify assay error sources that require improvement. Taguchi's idea of continual quality improvement vs the notion of meeting or failing specification has been applied to clinical chemistry. In this article, I propose a model of assay performance that includes the terms random interferences and protocol-specific biases (a series of systematic errors). I explain these terms, as well as the consequences of failing to consider them. To validate an assay clinically, I recommend direct estimation of total analytical error from a method comparison. To identify assay error sources that require improvement, I recommend a multifactor protocol (in addition to a method comparison). Individual error sources are related to total analytical error with the use of an error propagation technique. Much of the proposed data analysis techniques are straightforward but not routinely practiced. I demonstrate principles with the use of a cholesterol assay.},

abstract = {The aims of this short note are two-fold. First, it shows that, for a random variable X, the area under the curve of its folded cumulative distribution function equals the mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the median. Such an equivalence implies that the MAD is the area between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of X and that for a degenerate distribution which takes the median as the only value. Secondly, it generalises the folded CDF to a p-folded CDF, and derives the equivalence between the area under the curve of the p-folded CDF and the weighted mean absolute deviation from the p-quantile (MADp). In addition, such equivalences give the MAD and MADp simple graphical interpretations. Some other practical implications are also briefly discussed.}

Several conventions for displaying error along with the data they modify are described and illustrated. Alternatives are offered that seem to provide improvements in the effective communication of error as well as increasing their ease, and hence their likelihood, of use. These alternatives are illustrated principally with data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.},
