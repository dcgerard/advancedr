# Learning Objectives

- Brief notes on if-else statements and for-loops.
- Chapter 4 from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
    - These lecture notes are mostly taken straight out of Hadley's book. Many thanks for making my life easier.

# Motivation

- If you are in this class, you should know how to use if-statements and for-loops. 

- Here, we will just briefly review them and discuss some aspects about them you may not know.

# If-statements

- You are used to if-else if-else statements, the proper syntax of which is:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    if (condition1) {
      # do something
    } else if (condition2) {
      # do something else
    } else {
      # do default behavior
    }
    ```


- **Exercise**: Suppose our control flow is to print `"foo"` if `a` is `TRUE`, to print `bar` if `b` is TRUE, and print `foobar` if both `a` and `b` are `TRUE`. If neither are `TRUE` then it should return an empty string. What is wrong with the following?
    ```{r}
    a <- TRUE
    b <- TRUE
    if (a) {
      "foo"
    } else if (b) {
      "bar"
    } else if (a & b) {
      "foobar"
    } else {
      ""
    }
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    foobar will never be printed because it checks the a condition first.
    ```

- For short statements, you can use one-liner syntax.
    ```{r}
    if (a) "foo" else "bar"
    ```

- If you have a vector of conditions, instead of using a for-loop, use `ifelse()`.

    ```{r}
    x <- runif(10)
    y <- ifelse(x < 0.5, "low", "high")
    
    ## equivalent for-loop
    y <- rep(NA_real_, length.out = length(x))
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      y[[i]] <- if (x[[i]] < 0.5) "low" else "high"
    }
    ```

- If you have a lot of `else if` statements, then you can use `switch()`.

    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    if (a == 1) {
      "b"
    } else if (a == 2) {
      "c"
    } else if (a == 3) {
      "d"
    } else {
      stop("a not 1, 2, or 3")
    }
    
    switch(a,
           `1` = "b",
           `2` = "c",
           `3` = "d",
           stop("a not 1, 2, or 3"))
    ```

    - Make sure the last item is a `stop()` call, otherwise `switch()` will return `NULL`.
    
- **Exercise** (From Advanced R):
    ```{r}
    x <- 1:10
    if (length(x)) "not empty" else "empty"
    
    x <- numeric()
    if (length(x)) "not empty" else "empty"
    ```
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    `0` is coerced to `FALSE`, and all other values are coerced to `TRUE`
    ```
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    as.logical(c(-1, 0, 1))
    ```

# For-loops

- You are used to the basic for-loop:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    for (variable in vector) {
      # do stuff
    }
    ```

- You can also do for-loops on one line
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    for (i in 1:10) print(i)
    ```

- `next` exits the current iteration.

    ```{r}
    for (i in 1:5) {
      if (i == 3) next
      print(i)
    }
    ```

- `break` exits the entire for loop.

    ```{r}
    for (i in 1:3) {
      if (i == 3) break
      print(i)
    }
    ```


- Because of copy-on-modify, make sure to always preallocate your output before using a for-loop.
    
    ```{r}
    ## BAD
    x <- c()
    for (i in 1:10) x <- c(x, i)
    
    ## GOOD
    x <- rep(NA_real_, length.out = 10)
    for (i in 1:10) x[[i]] <- i
    ```

- Let's quantify this. On my laptop, the first for-loop takes 10 seconds. The second takes 0.009 seconds. That's about 100 times slower.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## BAD
    x <- c()
    system.time(
      for (i in 1:100000) x <- c(x, i)
    )
    
    ## GOOD
    x <- rep(NA_real_, length.out = 100000)
    system.time(
      for (i in 1:100000) x[[i]] <- i
    )
    ```

- Never use `1:length(x)`. This will fail if `x` has length 0. Instead, use `seq_along()`.

    ```{r}
    x <- c()
    1:length(x)
    seq_along(x)
    ```

- You can iterate over arbitrary vectors, but I think this is usually bad practice, since it is harder to read and is less standard. You can always iterate over an integer sequence whenever you want to iterate over something else.

    ```{r}
    ## Works, but bad practice
    x <- c("a", "b", "c")
    for (y in x) {
      print(y)
    }
    
    ## Works, and good practice
    x <- c("a", "b", "c")
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      print(x[[i]])
    }
    ```


# Advanced R Exercises

1. Why does this code succeed without errors or warnings?
    ```{r}
    x <- numeric()
    out <- vector("list", length(x))
    for (i in 1:length(x)) {
      out[i] <- x[i] ^ 2
    }
    out
    ```
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    The first iteration gives us `NA`^2, since `x[1]` is `NA`, and assigns that to the first element of `out`. The second iteration assigns a zero-length vector to a zero-length vector, but substution doesn't happen in such a case.
    ```
    
2. Why doesn't this for-loop go on forever?
    ```{r}
    xs <- c(1, 2, 3)
    for (x in xs) {
      xs <- c(xs, x * 2)
    }
    xs
    ```
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    R will use evaluate the indexing vector only once.
    ```
    

3. What does the following code tell you about when the index is updated?
    ```{r}
    for (i in 1:3) {
      i <- i * 2
      print(i) 
    }
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    It is updated at the beginning of each for-loop.
    ```
